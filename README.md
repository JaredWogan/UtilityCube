# UtilityCube
This was my grade 12 culminating project, and has been uploaded on my previous Github [here.](https://github.com/QuantumNebulae/UtilityCubeV2)

The project involved calculating molar masses of molecules, determining limiting reagants in reactions, as well as calculating permuations and combinations. The project was quite simple and was my first real introduction into programming. There is also a tic tac toe game included in the project, which I was also able to fully program in an 'AI', one which would either play randomly, or play optimally.
